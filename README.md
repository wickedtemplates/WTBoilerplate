# Wicked Templates Boilerplate ready to use it with SASS or LESS

### Steps to download and install

**I assume you have preview experience with git, node and the CLI**
1. First, create your new project folder. *If you're using VS Code, open a new terminal and write next*

```javascript
git clone https://github.com/wickedtemplates/WTBoilerplate.
```

2. Once the repo is on your computer, let's install it.

```javascript
npm install
```

3. Now, you already have installed node-sass and a brilliant folder structure for your new project.

4. Move your HTML template templateName.html to the folder **public**

### Finished!

Now you can style it as you want, **remember** you can use SASS as it's preinstalled.
Go to the folder tree and open SCSS/main.scss, *edit here your HTML*

## SASS OR LESS
### Compile and see results:

On your terminal write next:

```javascript
npm run compile:scss
or
npm run compile:less
```
Your SCSS/LESS file will be "translated" to the style.css.

## The public folder would be the one that needs to be published
